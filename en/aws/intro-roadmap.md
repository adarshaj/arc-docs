- `arc-env` infra env var and configuration management
- `text/javascript` and `text/css` route handlers
- `arc-docs`: examples and guides

## Ongoing and Future Scope

- `arc-docs` translations!
- `arc-dns` to paper over the API Gateway, AWS Certificate Manager and Route53 setup
- Add `@static` to `.arc` for CloudFront of S3 static assets
- Syntax highlighting for `.arc` in popular editors and Prism so this site looks nicer
- Ports to other clouds
