# Quickstart

From an installation perspective, `architect` is a set of `npm run` scripts and an otherwise vanilla Node project.

This documentation, and indeed the `architect` code itself, assumes you're running `Node@6.10` and `npm@3.10.10` default install to remain consistent with the AWS Lambda runtime.

## Get started 

1. [Set up your AWS Credentials](/quickstart/setup)
2. [Create a project and install architect](/quickstart/install)
3. [Review the project layout](/quickstart/arc-project-layout)
