Code of Conduct

## Get the Code

`architect` repos (and issue trackers) can be found here:

- `arc-create` creates cloud infrastructure from a `.arc` file
- `arc-deploy` deploys cloud functions from a `.arc` file
- `arc-functions` author cloud function signatures
- `arc-sandbox` run an `.arc` file offline, locally and in memory
- `arc-modules` proxy `npm install`, `uninstall`, `link` and `update` to all `.arc` defined cloud functions
- `arc-parser` parses `.arc` text into a plain JavaScript `Object`
- `arc-docs` this very website

## Get Help

- Come chat w us in the JS Foundation Slack
- Use the issue trackers above

## Helping Out

`architect` is open source and we need your help! Introduce yourself in the issue trackers or chat. &#x1f49e;

## Alternative Solutions

If you are evaluating `architect` we also reccomend checking out:

- this space intentially blank for now! norobots

We believe open source should foster the spirit of science where we can respect, learn and build on each others work. There will be more than one way to provision and deploy cloud functions. The solutions listed above will meet some project and team needs better than `architect`.

## A Very Brief History

Naming things is hard. `architect` started out as `arc` which itself was an acronym for `amazon run commands`. But mostly we just call it `arc` anyhow. The code was developed for and then extracted from begin.com and granted to JS Foundation in July of 2017 under the `Apache-2.0` license.
