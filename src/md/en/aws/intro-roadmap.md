# Roadmap

`architect` is open source so you can help! Jump over to the [community page](/intro/community) to get more info about becoming a contributer.

## Nearterm

- `.arc` validation and meaningful errors
- `text/html` and `text/css` route handlers
- `arc-create` support for structured http errors
- `arc-configure` for infrastructure configuration management

## Ongoing and Future Scope

- `arc-docs` translations!
- `arc-dns` to paper over the API Gateway, AWS Certificate Manager and Route53 setup
- Add `@static` to `.arc` for CloudFront of S3 static assets
- Syntax highlighting for `.arc` in popular editors and Prism so this site looks nicer
- Ports to other clouds
